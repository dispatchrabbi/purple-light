# purple-light
Make your blink(1) glow colors when an El train approaches.

## Setup
1. Plug in your blink(1).
1. Clone the repo and all that good stuff.
1. `npm install`
1. Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js` and fill in your relevant details.
1. `node ./index.js`
1. Bask in the glory of your blink(1) and the CTA talking to each other.

## Roadmap
* Make the "working" colors the same colors as the lines.
* Add a walk-distance offset.
* Use the top and bottom LEDs to indicate the next two arrivals.
* Handle stations as well as stops.
* Add a geolocation feature so it automatically figures out what stop you're near.
* Make sure it works on a Raspberry Pi. :no_entry: *BLOCKED BY: I do not own a Raspberry Pi.*
